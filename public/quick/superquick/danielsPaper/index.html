 <h1> introduction </h1>
 <p> Data is huge these days </p>
 <p> Real time location systems (RLTS) are things used to track stuff in 3d space. there are [examples] of these systems, which can track stuff big and small to varying accuracy. put one of these on patients, and It was shown that it helps with scheduling and made things more efficient</p>

 <p> A lot of these tests were in the US. we tryn do it in Africa</p>
 <p> our study evalutates Smart Spot (uganda) we tell you about how its good</p>
 <h1> Methods/ study setting </h1>
 <p> we implemented the system at UMIhospital (38 beds) [describe traffic]  and our study operated at [time frame] </p>
 <h2> Materials / hardware</h2>
  <p> bluetooth keychain/ gateways/ server</p>
  <p> we attached the lanyard to the patient with colors according to the urgentness. the thing had a button that could record treatments? and we recorded where they went according to Fig 1</p>
  <p>we measured where they were by seeing how strong the bluetooth signal was relative to where the gateways were placed?</p>
  <p> we smoothed data using [algo]. and we logged when they did stuff like traveling and got treatment</p>
  <p> we used [softwares] to dampen the noise</p>
