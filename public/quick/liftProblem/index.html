    the current model has the following assumptions
    1. the lift instantaneously loads and unloads passengers & accelerates to full speed immediately
    2. the lift only has 1 person inside it (if it is going up)
    
    
    to further improve the model, it is very easy to fix both of these problems.
    
    you can define a "stopping time" for the lift to load and unload passengers. add 2 stopping times when going up (unloading passenger + loading you in the ground floor). add 1 stopping time when going down (loading you in the ground floor)
    
    to solve problem 2, it is also trivial.
    we can assume that every single floor has an equal chance of passengers unloading. the "highest floor" given F floors left and N passengers will be F/(N+1)

    so finally we know how many stops there are, and which floor is the mean highest floor.
