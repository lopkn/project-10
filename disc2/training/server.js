Ng(`Consider the argument that you should take an umbrella (on p. 5, above). If
premise (1) is false— if it is sunny outside— then the argument gives you no
reason to carry an umbrella. Even if it is raining outside, you might not need an
umbrella. You might wear a rain pancho or keep to covered walkways. In these
cases, premise (2) would be false, since you could go out without an umbrella
and still avoid getting soaked.
Suppose for a moment that both the premises are true. You do not own a rain
pancho. You need to go places where there are no covered walkways. Now does
the argument show you that you should take an umbrella? Not necessarily.
Perhaps you enjoy walking in the rain, and you would like to get soaked. In
that case, even though the premises were true, the conclusion would be false.
For any argument, there are two ways that it could be weak. First, one or
more of the premises might be false. An argument gives you a reason to believe
its conclusion only if you believe its premises. Second, the premises might fail
to support the conclusion. Even if the premises were true, the form of the
argument might be weak. The example we just considered is weak in both
ways.
When an argument is weak in the second way, there is something wrong with
the logical form of the argument: Premises of the kind given do not necessarily
lead to a conclusion of the kind given. We will be interested primarily in the
8 forallx
logical form of arguments.
Consider another example:
You are reading this book.
This is a logic book.
.˙. You are a logic student.
This is not a terrible argument. Most people who read this book are logic
students. Yet, it is possible for someone besides a logic student to read this book.
If your roommate picked up the book and thumbed through it, they would not
immediately become a logic student. So the premises of this argument, even
though they are true, do not guarantee the truth of the conclusion. Its logical
form is less than perfect.
An argument that had no weakness of the second kind would have perfect logical
form. If its premises were true, then its conclusion would necessarily be true.
We call such an argument ‘deductively valid’ or just ‘valid.’
Even though we might count the argument above as a good argument in some
sense, it is not valid; that is, it is ‘invalid.’ One important task of logic is to
sort valid arguments from invalid arguments.
1.4 Deductive validity
An argument is deductively valid if and only if it is impossible for the premises
to be true and the conclusion false.
The crucial thing about a valid argument is that it is impossible for the premises
to be true at the same time that the conclusion is false. Consider this example:
Oranges are either fruits or musical instruments.
Oranges are not fruits.
.˙. Oranges are musical instruments.
The conclusion of this argument is ridiculous. Nevertheless, it follows validly
from the premises. This is a valid argument. If both premises were true, then
the conclusion would necessarily be true.
This shows that a deductively valid argument does not need to have true
premises or a true conclusion. Conversely, having true premises and a true
conclusion is not enough to make an argument valid. Consider this example:
London is in England.
ch. 1 what is logic? 9
Beijing is in China.
.˙. Paris is in France.
The premises and conclusion of this argument are, as a matter of fact, all true.
This is a terrible argument, however, because the premises have nothing to do
with the conclusion. Imagine what would happen if Paris declared independence
from the rest of France. Then the conclusion would be false, even though the
premises would both still be true. Thus, it is logically possible for the premises
of this argument to be true and the conclusion false. The argument is invalid.
The important thing to remember is that validity is not about the actual truth
or falsity of the sentences in the argument. Instead, it is about the form of
the argument: The truth of the premises is incompatible with the falsity of the
conclusion.
Inductive arguments
There can be good arguments which nevertheless fail to be deductively valid.
Consider this one:
In January 1997, it rained in San Diego.
In January 1998, it rained in San Diego.
In January 1999, it rained in San Diego.
.˙. It rains every January in San Diego.
This is an inductive argument, because it generalizes from many cases to a
conclusion about all cases.
Certainly, the argument could be made stronger by adding additional premises:
In January 2000, it rained in San Diego. In January 2001. . . and so on. Re-
gardless of how many premises we add, however, the argument will still not be
deductively valid. It is possible, although unlikely, that it will fail to rain next
January in San Diego. Moreover, we know that the weather can be fickle. No
amount of evidence should convince us that it rains there every January. Who
is to say that some year will not be a freakish year in which there is no rain
in January in San Diego; even a single counter-example is enough to make the
conclusion of the argument false.
Inductive arguments, even good inductive arguments, are not deductively valid.
We will not be interested in inductive arguments in this book.
10 forallx
1.5 Other logical notions
In addition to deductive validity, we will be interested in some other logical
concepts.
Truth-values
True or false is said to be the truth-value of a sentence. We defined sentences
as things that could be true or false; we could have said instead that sentences
are things that can have truth-values.
Logical truth
In considering arguments formally, we care about what would be true if the
premises were true. Generally, we are not concerned with the actual truth value
of any particular sentences— whether they are actually true or false. Yet there
are some sentences that must be true, just as a matter of logic.
Consider these sentences:
1. It is raining.
2. Either it is raining, or it is not.
3. It is both raining and not raining.
In order to know if sentence 1 is true, you would need to look outside or check the
weather channel. Logically speaking, it might be either true or false. Sentences
like this are called contingent sentences.
Sentence 2 is different. You do not need to look outside to know that it is true.
Regardless of what the weather is like, it is either raining or not. This sentence
is logically true; it is true merely as a matter of logic, regardless of what the
world is actually like. A logically true sentence is called a tautology.
You do not need to check the weather to know about sentence 3, either. It must
be false, simply as a matter of logic. It might be raining here and not raining
across town, it might be raining now but stop raining even as you read this, but
it is impossible for it to be both raining and not raining here at this moment.
The third sentence is logically false; it is false regardless of what the world is
like. A logically false sentence is called a contradiction.
To be precise, we can define a contingent sentence as a sentence that is
neither a tautology nor a contradiction.
A sentence might always be true and still be contingent. For instance, if there
never were a time when the universe contained fewer than seven things, then
ch. 1 what is logic? 11

the financials are significantly better but if you dig it's literally worse than what we have Saturday or they have overhead up there being a middle line and the company so we didn't maybe this is probably going to have to spend some money and doing the message so if you go back to the timeline here it's actually see that supply chain which consolidation happened earlier process especially if you hear about your brand new aircraft solution friendship so we're trying to get or whatever thrive in future development you think that's something I'm not scared period I'm not scared periodyou're going to have a lot of connection place that cost time that comes from Admissions and it comes a lot of things don't have their inefficiency what do you have in your airplane I think connect a smaller amount of people to see those two places you're able to gain more profit and that is why you come to this number and you think that this is a conservative everyone other than the middle guy was stuttering so hard yeah I feel like I feel like we're like you know I don't feel pressure from people now I actually want to do the presentation now just to see what would happen PPI Credit Union they have power plant because I was doing stuff it would have been better who's going to be in the entrepreneurship Club

 

I really want a guy to s*** themselves on stage don't you havefor the strength because Boeing has been in industry for a very long time since 1960 okay how many celebration industry one of them is actually horrible company culture but we see opportunities doing Over the Horizon and adjustment of supply chain what increase quality check I'm doing migrating to other companies because of that company culture and also rival companies increasing Innovation and being Boeing so going and dealing with multiple issues that are presenting them from balance of that their main issue currently is their maximum Advantage seems to be effective Technical and Engineering Focus as well as I'm not Innovative company called true message apartments in progress stakeholders are also suffering from going to print obstacles Investments are currently seeing lack of profits and have not received action plan as as to what building was doing for change in the situation employees are facing a toxic work environment and issues with her management and are preventing pushing for improvements and Innovation because humans are also lacking safety are also allowed to safety policies to make sure that their protection is Big prioritize so if there's one thing that is clear that game faster route they manufactured everything in-house and it allows them to be more Innovative in their designs and control the quality of the price of something but otherwise have to pay for those parts so I've been going adults about similar to this and how many helpful billion dollars on premiums for houses per now 10.2 million dollars on premiums this truck compared to the materials cost of those so comma it's going to cut down on the amount they can increase or anything from 5:00 p.m. very bad financial crisis so how how can boiling influences Financial obviously it's hard to calculate the specific costs of something like this but we can propose an annual budget for five billion dollars towards influencing this use of liking in community R&B propose to cover these costs initially by selling from by selling assets from one month from going to 15 minutes in the United States period as possible solution is a restricted so I don't know if he's still looking good performinghe's going to increase collaboration communication with their Department to make sure that there were container free and on the state regular reports to the board of directors and physical Improvement program ability when I take care of as well can you please announcements I am local Envelope as the current treatment engineer and the second vice president and hearing has two helpful in hearing like the first president of property was released structuring will be implemented the first one that would be medicated to the training for every strategies with responsibility or of course that is fine right now instructions bring it to haveies now the second most visited the source of investor confident and health summer satisfaction however with the current issue of quality and safety the long-term improvements will actually read that confidence and satisfaction because there will be a better team that will focus on Innovation about identifying now listen to our final solution it's because many instances of workers actually telling us that there's a hostel word environment?? I also flosstate how many culture for employees are so today and collaborative of data leaves but the way that we can imagine this and having relatives in place and also Insurance solid track records for the third party a whistle Lord and the second is the quality and reports of verification of both in this meeting report that may happen however we will be ensuring this by cross checking information with internal employees and also implementing standard operational procedures to ensure the best quality of these reports no it was our minute thank you so much I feel like they were alive neon boy are you going back Rebecca to my order section I think we were in the same ropesstructure developed around Wisconsin you must have to retired our new services expertise thank you again but then the first judges I think they knew that we were first so they were like coming up easy on us yeah no I don't think they are easy oh no the first judges like I think we got a worst mark for a first job really okay maybe Dempsey and then you say yeah and then why though just wanted to make your house yet we did Mommy which ones Tennessee do you have a picture of like the Rosa people cuz that's how they chose 


so we have no chance they chose something though and good afternoon smiley face I'm here Victoria Jason Stevens and Frank and Mario concerts to help going bring each other to success
period changed her mindset of financial possibly we're going to the concert which I can Google buses same beats sustainability to be 19 satisfaction right now he has a company are over looking issues and this is not helping our customers reach the cleaning experience and overall we can eat our our competitive positioning and now I would like to do it to Jason for myself opportunities I think that is for investing in environmental development and movement worker management relations and restructuring the board while some friends that came so include mailing public recession I'll change the reputation so amazing game in going issues is that really you need sales and to the the candy sales goodis more transparency and operational efficiency or how the backgrounds engineering or law or the special ones that don't have that and the reason why the two layers here is enough to see their brand new to new model of plane the 737 Max crashed three times on three major crashes and over 1800 technical report on it and it's got so the fact that there's some medication Slide the probability of hiring a updated in the median since we are going to be driving test on all of them and the severity of letting someone in would be by Ice since they could diminish our income now another issue could be management so since we are going to be rapidly changing the business there is bound to be chaos I'm on the employees and the government we are going to be slowly taking into our new project requirements as well as everyone can see where contributing a portion of our profit where sometimes 2018 as well as recurrency voting is in the Aerospace industry while some of the organizations growing up with to be able to meet at the industries and the probability of us period always find anything the number implementation of positive being so we we should do Harvard Business School like and to prepare for college information needed and then ask yourself to me that is a huge difference secondly for a charity solution this is initiative and we want to do it five persons over 30 going to be able to take a longer time you might just slowly so you stayed in the United Way to not just walk with our already unstable company and secondly for going crazy it'll be a long conclusionfrom the pandanas but however in the past for you in the past few years and explain to me the only has been on the right to be back on track since the Talk versus the entire company however the benefit of this it doesn't make me around for the week billion dollars so for the cost for McDonald's going to be so for the R&D in 2023 we still needed are reinvested 3.3 million billion dollars into technology however we respect to increase this to 4.5 billion in order to increase thank you the new doctor technology next year we expected to go extinctly and so I I agreements questions kissy face kissy face going to be square more focused on the money part and that we want to go back to the more family side question mark but we can make sure like overall intelligence's girlfriend on we have the upper decking together competitors again it will hook up in office in the longer could you clarify where to 5% donation is going to work so we got the password just from researching on how the average how much the average company donates and we will have this little friend I think that's only because all right images and we did get the issue with me before but good program is true because it has been successful in the past already so we just wanted to bring it back together exclamation point GoogleI think we were so on the same level of these guys like I feel like we did we did so similarly yeah the final finalist wait are they the final finalists or are they the second finald they were the third okay yeah so so they're still two more yeah yeah of course yeah yeah definitely 100% cuz of you cuz you cuz you your personality you have everything not right now because I'm not in the mood your energetic I'm tired it's not going to go well your energetic I'm tired it's not going to go wellyeah I feel like you're a lot of things but you're one of them or not wait that's the last person can we go no they're the second one you're the one who said you wanted to see how bad they are or get humble but they're so cool they're not even that good what did law professional focus on save me a best friend additionally because of that they wanted to cost on their products product quality which overall because it's not things that you want to see governance manufacturing and Labor Management effectively Adams industry so we have three solutions so we're going to do because then on today and with our impact of 4.99 billion profit and new not focus on thinking instead of profit and finally an improved international relations and CSR so strange to boys I love you have many streams of income well because it's include confidence and leadership as many of them want to prioritize getting money over quality opportunities include their partnership with NASA and threats include their kind of reputation as many people want to work with them or pay for their products so here's a competitive analysis as you can see going in slow and quality and a reputable professors recommendation programs senior Leaders with Engineers we're going to do this time and parents and Men teeth and scheduling regular meeting this recommendation is that we are able to see both sides of Engineers and Premiere leaders you can have technical advantages will help to create Innovation as there will be different and diverse leadership stuff and he also we also believe that it will increase the pr as episode of the public that we are interested in engineer there might be some compatibility issues but we are going to have open ended communication from the very beginning and we also think that the buying success metrics 1950 pickles so we're going to start doing this through surveys and feedback okay recommendation in order to have a collaboration with essay arrows as far from it start commission go ahead and ask yourself towards blowing confirmation I was failing fishing so we focused on the carbonization as well as safe to get aircraft what does partition is an AI pack company startup to apply for Aerospace improving safety and operation so it just Falls more stuff I am 7145 a.m. obituary but nowlast recommendation is Boeing and confusion Plus so the objective of this is to fuel cell Energy so instead of using multiplication smiley face another one is a pizza spot on 100% stop by 3:30 to increase the definition about 13 so some benefits and opportunities is that this is a this build a present which which highlights going Focus around 11% fabric for you last night so that you can be implemented to ensure that the hydrogen and just that we make are really up to the qualities and consistency of our customers by 2007 Yara and a 18 approval and then influence it near the start of $3.28 thank you Google this is why you need it I didn't feel my ass hydrogen feel my ass if anyone like literally a little bit fluent in in science they wouldn't know that you don't want to save anymore oh my God f*** you Dad Dadwhat are some regulatory room with respect to Facebookwhat are some regulatory room with respect to Facebookcomma I think that's a really definitely be seeing that yes it is a new technology however we can look at other airlines that are also doing this same development and see how they're doing it but also come up with you like 4% so I didn't stop it okay we calculate about the operation efficient safety competitive as well that's like the emergency please I just totally fill out the number period all right thank you team contacts is that it is the last one yeah they going to be important oh no you can't talk okay I love this I love it okay you got it I thought it wasn't anything any of your questions answered for anyone on the exact team as well as our Board of Elections over here so without further Ado will be announcing the 5th and Final finalist can I get in trouble please a****** Martinwhat things are not made with one metal or plastic okay it's kind of funny yeah yeah you went to sleep it's not like Sonic today significant challenges with safety concerns all right so exactly what his phone cases so first of all it's strange is that over 40% always Market however it is losing significant amount of profit and also classes with the values after we're doing 20 systems McDonald's it's all changing lives in Market action and that is application and his threat are increased competition between air plus and being grouping back and also doing the crack representation all right so the problem with this could be grouped towards culture misalignment but we split this into three parts animation stagnation reputational challenges and opportunities of operational challenges all right so for sale with Innovation Foundation this is mainly the cause of three days probably maximization executive of engineering place to see and the business model which focuses on rebounding over Innovation the last true like everybody introduced was in 2003 to 777 all right we're going to take some challenges there's a lot of safety I'm industrial concerns specifically with the ground and airplanes such as the 737 Max just both of the huge problem and also said fine shade destructions also the list of low reports have added onto the issue and password the company and lastly for operational challenges?? a valuing talking to me over Innovation at untrustworthy safety checks with the FAA contract has led the company to filter three out of 89 since the August what is some 37 okay now let's do a competitive analysis well voted by somebody's address that'sto the global market one of the key stakeholders any of those of incoming matching organisms academic review America locations what happened but you better I thought you were bring the first phase of our implementation you find the invest in the Rd where I was going to face who you will begin first one face we hope to she's looking scale and implement someone that's called who died specifically the first year when they will try to reshuffle the board to create the more but they're really the business more games conducting research with FAA and Airline representatives to create a saint services and accelerating moonshot with University to accelerate research and then the long term we hope to bring back the headquarters to Seattle as well as integrate from the technology of developed into commercials rightI need a team like that I need you right he didn't settle or anything if you if you send it to him I will actually not talk to you when you eat your lunch call me later when you eat your lunch call me laterit's not it's not correct I thinkif they don't win when I mean it's just unfair world this is the only thing that was actually competence like every single one of them yeah every single one of them they want that you want that let's just go downwe missed out somethingwe missed out somethingoh that was that was onoh that was that was onyou going tomorrow you got to talk about this oh do you want to see our presentation oh okay present so our thing was about Boeing and how they are like competing against Airbus so we did yeah so we did the person like this is yours this is exactly like what you're going to be doing for your real yeah and then there are packs goals and their present goals don't align so originally they were focused on Innovation and right now they're focused on finance and cutting stuff which is this is why it's really bad right now right so if you are our recommendations because the people that asked the five finalists we were like literally on par with them except for one group was really really and then yeah and so this is an implementation and hear the like the general time to rest the complications so these two are in parallel so we have to change the management f*** yourself and then parallel we start cutting contractors and we also start introducing new safer planes yeah risk and mitigation and for our financial I did this originally they invested like 6.5 billion dollars in 2009 and they were decreasing that budget ever since and so we plan to increase it through a couple of years back to 5.5 billion but also divert some money to address currency issues right and we want to centralize their Productions because they're International things and it's really hard to coordinate the parts of the plane that comes together so we plan on trying to centralize the entire production line and this is a conclusions they have a they have like a Q&A session oh there's a sources so good they have a Q&A session pictures I want pictures here how doesprofessional newsapology District period periodcompetition that we did yesterday Leo Natalia's competition all weekend so they were so hard and it was like 12 hour days I think can really a business case and then having to present to there's that one and it wasn't there a Rothman one as well yeah that one's doing like 5 days I don't think we're we're done we tried we tried to this one they allowed 11 12s right the other one's or no it's nice who went to Ivy and I believe it was ID case and ID case that they used that they had to do present the case graduated from ibmba and he's a big business case guy like I consulted with him for many years and he's always approaching everything with that case alley but it was cool is done something else the structure of the case is there anything they had to do a competitive analysis they had to do timeline timeline University it's that case you know it's that step by step thinking unpacking things approach and putting a structure to it with them I mine is called initiatives theirs was recommendations recommendations initiatives whatever you want to however you want to slice and dice it but that makes me happy but I'm actually that is the consistent and that it's prepping you to consistent and that it's prepping you tookay Nick we got in the news what's going on so much going on in the news I saw Scarlett Johansson actually put out quite a rigorous statement about her voice about the whole time lineup stolen they approached her she said no then the day before they launched I forget what it's called sky hey can we use your voice but they already copied it and they launched it the next day so like so bad so unethical and the implications are anyway what's up with you all right so this was a article from not too long ago so the FBI is investigating missing ancient Treasures from the British museum this is a article posted by the BBC so the FBI is investigating the sale of two US buyers of water suspected to be hundreds of treasures from the British museum so a year back that the British museum announced that some ancient gems jewelry and other items from its collection were missing stolen or damaged and apparently one buyer from New Orleans said that he bought two of those pieces off of eBay and now that the robbers are still unknown so prefixing yeah so the FBI's been brought in to find this and it's the Bridge Museum says that a 1500 or $1,500 items are estimated to be stolen or missing and $626 of them have been recovered and a hundred of them have been found but not yet brought back and yeah and apparently a senior curator is accused of by the British Museum of stealing these items for like certain robbers and apparently he pocketed a total of 100,000 British pounds for this okay so my opinions of course this is really bad this is some security has to be some security precautions have to be taken the fact that the FBI has to step in for you know this highly established Foundation is quite a serious matter and yeah so my questions are what kind of safety precautions can they take or or what kind of British museum do to address this problem slightly yes what we would callspace space of e-commerce how do we regulate that how do we What could regulate that how do we What couldgetting marketed on these platforms anybody have any ideas yeah I think eBay is kind of well like the middleman in between like they they're not directly liable for putting it on the side right but they're the middle man like they're the mule for transporting the item and selling the item so I think I think they need to be like at least somewhat accountable for this type of stuff or at least there needs to be a system to you know like take it down fast enough right so that is not just letting people do this all the time selling like Solon items yeah it's hard yeah it's hardinterested to know who like you know the people that said two people bought artifacts on Maple who was selling them one person bought two artifactsI feel like eBay should have like a database or something where institutions like the museum could upload items that were stolen and then eBay could somehow catalog and make sure they're not selling stolen items well I think his store like a temporary history of transactions like they could delete it just for people's privacy after a couple hours but I mean it and you should be like kind of tracked where the stuff is going right sometimes you don't have enough people like or the thing was stolen like 5 hours ago and you just can't track it and that's just a big problem you can't stop it well I think his store like a temporary history of transactions like they could delete it just for people's privacy after a couple hours but I mean it and you should be like kind of tracked where the stuff is going right sometimes you don't have enough people like or the thing was stolen like 5 hours ago and you just can't track it and that's just a big problem you can't stop itregulation around peer-to-peer or consumer but it's amazingly growing part of the commas I mean I think of my 13 year old nephew about it and his buddies they're amazing commas I mean I think of my 13 year old nephew about it and his buddies they're amazinglast weekend with his Lego Johnny is Legos 13 and now my nephew is fully into shoes he's going out and drifting and buying all these shoes like she got a pair of shoes for 100 and andhe special edition like something or others but he went and got them at least he goes out to the thrift shops and I'm like oh the house lights and he knows ideal I'm not all on Facebook Marketplace is funny because you wouldn't touch Facebook for the Titanfall her social media but for selling stuff that's now he has finally has a Facebook account because he is so yeah interesting wow when did this happen all right I'm going to get some water and then we're going to talk about

you're not in the bowl sideall these things all these things grab a teacher right this is the this is the center of service right the men of course then straight men straight women gettingthat helps us to appreciate cultural appropriation and discrimination of others right and and anything that's not here socially we demons if you're bilingual it's more power right like here and learn English

slowly argumentative Commack designer designerassignment that I want you to all right so our position now would be in our position of privilege is it's something especially coming from privilege that we take for granted right we don't even think about it because it doesn't fantastic our position now would be in our position of privilege is it's something especially coming from privilege that we take for granted right we don't even think about it because it doesn't fantasticwhere we get things get sticky is when we don't see our privilege and we make assumptions about folks who are perhaps not as close to the bullseye on the wheel right and I think the biggest sort of lesson to take from from reflecting on your positionalities seeing where you sit and hear is that reflecting on your positionalities seeing where you sit and hear is thatmaking assumptions and definitely about lanes that you're not in are and especially when you're way closer to the bullseye than other folks are that's that is something that means that's that's privilege a placea place where we're we acknowledge you know we appreciated like knowledge our own privilege and recognize that other folks are not all in the same boat as us when I can tell you for sure you know just when I think about other schools you know I think about other schools that I've taught other schools you know I think about other schools that I've taughtthe access we have to make sure look at the access we have to resources we're in a computer lab I know that even other schools in the district don't have their business courses in a lab right like we're so I'm so much I get to have because that's what I want to be right it's important we're doing or crazy business documents we're you know we got a lot of things we need to do in a computer much I get to have because that's what I want to be right it's important we're doing or crazy business documents we're you know we got a lot of things we need to do in a computerbut that's not the case at every school right so definitely need to see our positionality we're just going to say that we don't have our stories right we don't have our big women unless we're not the people don't have as much power don't make too much money you don't have as much political power as men especially in as men especially inwhat I want you to do now so you know I'm happy I'm going to take a look at what I hope everybody turned in something in terms of reflecting on what I hope everybody turned in something in terms of reflecting onwere you kind of died but I want you to just I've frozen in the Sun through all of this app and I want you to go away now and get your head around what is cultural appropriation what is it for me what's cultural Exchange understanding the difference between cultural appropriation and cultural Exchange and then I want you to find and then I want you to findwithin your state right be an e-commerce or be a marketing and make marketing like my goodness so you know it's just an in the social media and different platforms cultural Appropriations just random in an online settings so I want you to find some examples too demonstrate to me demonstrate to meunderstand what the meaning of cultural appropriation is and then see if you can find any examples of cultural Exchange you know where there's a where there's very challenging very challenging thing my my advice always is if something is racist or you think something is racist or you thinkprivilege you have the less you get to decide you don't get to decisions you know he we don't come from that lens you have that as white people not I'm saying myself here I don't get to decide I listen and having nothing really learning and having nothing really learningit's uncomfortable space but always good old style up have I don't assume judge and don't ever be the voice of a group that you don't belong to right that's all you get to be the voice of your spot and you listen to others period you need to Define need to go out and start for yourself or get your head around cultural completion I've posted so there's a posted in files guiding questions to ask yourself right when you're looking at something that you think that feels like it might be cultural appropriation feel is it is this honoring or is this you know like this question to ask yourself what's the source of whatever it is that you're looking at right what's a significance no is it sacred it's considered sacred and culture other than no is it sacred it's considered sacred and culture other thanhow similar is it to the original is it commodified is somebody else making a prop using imagery or language or art that is not theirs and then just a couple of notes that you know people most often do not have bad attention right like when I talk to you my every year my grating literacy class they make somebody makes memes using Black Faces using and we have a conversation about it right they don't have bad intentions they just aren't educated my every year my grating literacy class they make somebody makes memes using Black Faces using and we have a conversation about it right they don't have bad intentions they just aren't educatedit doesn't affect stuff right it doesn't they don't care so it's abouts and it can be hard for people to Define culture because we are Colonial we are settlers the morning visible a culture is to the dominant culture the easier it is to be important to be and are the harder it is so did that for you to use as a guy and you did that for you to use as a guy and youI work through this for your examples right so when you find your examples use that framework and so watch the video and then through the research to define the following cultural appropriation cultural appreciation culturally State and cultural commodity and then find an example of each of these definitions in recent marketing program and then find an example of each of these definitions in recent marketing programsocial media tiktoks whatever you know the one I was just watching about before and afro someone did this thing on tiktok before an afro and it's like so bad and then find example of each using the word scene complete and evaluation of the situation so using that framework that's up here block yourself through these block yourself through these cuz I don't and you're going to share it with the class on Wednesday I'm not here tomorrow I'm taking the freaking bus for the day so I'm not here tomorrow I'm taking the freaking bus for the day sopray for me yep it's a it's a show and tell don't it doesn't have to be a dad because it's wherever you want to do if you want to show you know obviously you want to show what you found but it's all I want I don't know I don't want to have a lot and get a whole bunch of really good examples and really good explanations and demonstrations of your understanding of probation appreciation ready Wednesday I find when you're actually having it in your hand and helpful so do you want me to work on something today for the document it's like a template right just fill in whatever you think you can't feel thank you it's pretty easy to like know what to post that's actually come from part is pretty easy I just need to know what to post are you calling me s*** up is it supposed to be like Apache PT yeah Instagram part is very easy what are you trying to do are you quoting what are you changing my grammar I want to bet you I betwell I don't think my voice speak turquoise and then he was Coldplay I could completely hidden not nothing not nothingI'm Leo no I came here this year you very nice Tyson yeah he's easy to recognize no I mean like subject music what are you learning music over here it's like playing instruments mandatory okay oh oh okay it's fine yeah Elementary Elementary?I'm be friends with that song be friends with that songyou can'tyou are telling us this is true why do we need for them yet and in your analysis they say respect person acts personstill not tell you why are you doing what is happening here I don't know where this is what happens every time yeah well I talk like okay we're talking about how life we went snow hours the law debating how courts should make decisions yeah and the moral reasoning no we were talking about how like we are assuming some of these equations right now yeah it is perfect but like we are we don't know the proof yet they that never taught us to poop what I brought up was because they give us a set of things that they say are true and then ask us to use those to prove other things they all said they are true in a certain way so my sort of question is if we're happy why aren't we being asked to prove the fundament more fundamental ones going to University are you going to be taking philosophy course there's a lot of money in the morning yeah there is some time with a minor in something either like political science economics or maybe something more like this like we were psychologist it sounds like very beautiful in this conversation but we awful at children we do some actions based off of this thing right completely okay maybe if I if I give this stuff to water to my mom it's a stifle so you're you're using this you're assuming that it's true and you're doing stuff with this information but we awful at children we do some actions based off of this thing right completely okay maybe if I if I give this stuff to water to my mom it's a stifle so you're you're using this you're assuming that it's true and you're doing stuff with this informationI think Argyle was the first room to have those or for school to have those handsworth now has him as well because everyone loves the those small little rooms again one thing they definitely scream garage door garage door every single classroom has one they are never open stuff there's also why like the science rooms are all spread out across the entire school cuz they're like oh let's have science math English and socialism together and have them collaborate with a Kevin 12 classroom with a class and that works so well at home those are your scheduling it so far it's like you need to schedule like if everything required tomorrow or anything but you don't have to be here until this week period and then 9:10 is when it actually so yeah it means you sit here and do nothing cuz you don't need to do anything did you wear handing of the dogwoods it's such a funny sentence it's not like the next next week it happened when the Raptors were basketball team would throw the Raptors were playing stuff Warriors of all the things of all the days again I would I would have thought parents could have waited till the end hello cheer itI feel bad for the 2020 and then especially and even like 2021 although I had I had it last year old school she went up a small group we have a parking lot so who was kind of weird like kind of nice we got closer view attending online party last year's graduating class never had a feel because the field only got completed this year and before that it was either the old school was there and even before that they were building the new school and the old deal so they never had a dealership no no one was being built here and the old school is at another place completely different song but you know we get all the time looks like yeah cuz now then rebuilt Carson's other than Mountainside isn't getting rebuilt but is getting renovated it's near Braemar it's actually really close to work it's Grade 9 to 12:00 p.m. I think Windsor is next up on Renovations and then still will and now they're starting on elementary schools too they're building a new one man without extra classrooms it's even now they're using there's if you go down to the wing over there they sort of these computer rooms and there's room behind the computer rooms which sometimes uses like films and stuff and one of those things had already turned into a classroom now they're already like me of stuff it's 11:40 it goes 910 to 10:20 yeah yeahdo you know where the purple guy tendency oh okay exclamation point question mark wereason reasonable for rational moral system should be able to be just any say this is what system should also be just justifiable in in another rational moral assistant okay there is only one completely totally rational moral system there is only one it's godhood you know everything and you know what to do look everything happens because the universe wants to increase entropy the agree with that yeah okay and life is an approximation by the universe to increase entropy faster did you know yes okay and and all the species bringing more entropy yes which is getting more wrong and wrong you know species competition is solely unrelated to entropy at this point but it's a horrible approximation of increasing entropy and you being happy like a conscious entity being happy is like humans trying to be happy is our individual approximation that is totally wrong from the universes but that is our goal yes we have a wrong goal that is so this allows me to dress right down the fundamental the goal of the universeUniverse wants to increase entropy and an attempt to do that life was created which is an approximation between what do you mean oh yeah if we wanted Earth to increase but the universe has an error function called uncertainty so it creates error and because Earth is such a big big thing it creates so much error that finally it's approximation is so wrong that it thinks of life is acceptable approximation of entropy okay okay so it creates error and because Earth is such a big big thing it creates so much error that finally it's approximation is so wrong that it thinks of life is acceptable approximation of entropy okay okayso let me just leave that money unless I can find is what I sent you the contact number I'mokay thanks Google oh have I got

don't like beans that's interesting yeah sure but like oh I didn't know that oh I've heard it from the South Park video oh my God that's why I always make sense now it all makes sense now thank you important life skills to have fun so I had to do work works that's good I'm at like a high 60 I still have three more tests to do so I'm only halfway through you're f****** with me what how many more tests for each of them okay so okay so you done three and you need to do three more calculator what's your average right now give an estimate low estimate 65 okay 65 you need to get it to 84 I'm doing that I'm doing thathe's a total of six tests six that's all that you will ever have no quizzes no like you know okay so it doesn't really matter you need 85th you need to get 105 for each of your test that's unfortunate okay what's your high ball for what your current average 69 you need to get 101 for all your tests okay let's say you do all your Corrections so that 69 gets bumped up to a 73 for each of them right that's the policy right so then you need to get 97% for each of the past to get to 85 80s so 80 is of 85.80 you need 95 for it the lowest possible with no Corrections 95 so it's kind of like a 94 you need 94 for each test oh no this is not the low one the lowest 65 right but low on you need to get 98% for each test and with low one with corrections is you need to do 94% I know that pizzica does bump up your score if you get like a like a 79 to an 80 yeah yeah but I know that for I think it's Johnson and physical if you don't participate from rat skip day they bump up your average just by simply showing up I don't want to do gradskip why do people do it you know what yeah counting your students during grass skip day is a good way to see if you're a good teacher okay so the highest score possible you have right now is 73 and so you will need a 90 for each of your tests is it your current average is 69 it doesn't look that good I thought you only need a 70 something okay made by somebody okay period periodpick a number you can have it babe I just forgot to have the seat but like we're cooking don't forget to add the seat he will I've gotten so many things f***** up for not adding a c but as in Hong Kong though I have their six courses at UT is looking at they're looking at three prerequisites those are the ones that actually matter and that's English 12 and alcohol so I got 91 for freak outsole where you buy a car why are you Batman I think I'm being way too nicely you're you're so stupid that's what I should have said and then there's another course that I'm using I got a 92 Counting accounting I can count to 1 2 4 5 it just can't fluctuate like it can be like between like 90 to 92 I tell you they're going to allow some margins like I think my average has just dropped by at least 4% because of English I write very critically of everything that I don't think is correct and I never write anything that I like I I wouldn't lie to myself about anything so like if if she said that this movie is good or did you guys read the totem how is it a satire it's not a satire it's not a funny thing like it was barely ironic barely satirical I was stupid basically yeah that's what I wrote yeah yeah well yeah I got a 72 in BC first people no you probably are but like I'm very good at English 82 I don't know not that improbable you know why I don't like your perfume because it's really distinct 4 years later I'm going to be on the street I'm going to smell like a little bit of that and I'm going to f*** myself over trying to remember what it was yeah because it's really distinct 4 years later I'm going to be on the street I'm going to smell like a little bit of that and I'm going to f*** myself over trying to remember what it was yeahno I have like very like signature smells or whatever you do it's not good I I f*** myself thinking about like any other person's perfume like it's I hate perfume it smells it smells good but I like it's like good music that you can only get to hear for like four times and then it's just gone and then whenever you hear like a now I forgot to turn oh s*** I got to find it I have I have OCD or something term in music whereas oh delete light Motif what's a light Motif yeah like Motif where yeah so it's like that so whenever I'm on a street and I hear that and like oh what song is that and I'm going to f*** myself over for like 2 days trying to think of it until I eventually get so sad and and forget about it yeah maybe my dad is not used cologne and my mom does not use perfume I want I would you're Italian I I would f*** my mom over for using any like she does she has like a brush and like why do you have a brush why are you using a brush like I'm actually angry I don't like I don't like people doing makeup or perfume especially makeup cuz it actually makes people look great well if you were like a little bit it's fine but when it's like way too much it just looks bad like if you weren't way too much makeup it's like if you're fat it's not like I actively hate them it's just up born instinct to not like some stuff okay okay how about this why do you why do people like dogs and cats but not like insects can be great pets too I like insects but most people don't that's exact same thing like humans are biased towards a thing which is why I also don't like the word cute because it's like the most prominent discrimination there is yeah I know I know you do I do like okay you are Tyson size no I told you I never touched Tyson and I never shook his hand even though he's offered like okay if I was like like let's say I just fell into like I don't know more like if I was crying and I really wanted a hug I can't imagine Tyson crying I can't imagine you being fat you're welcome me that's okay why do you guys not say I appreciate that instead of I appreciate you for that sound like something that you would say like a relationship that's so weird

like my washer actually I don't know why but like my mom never watches my clothes soon enough so after we're like every single shirt twice before like Yeah and I don't like the smell of my car cuz like it's just this this area just gets really bad especially like wash hands what else you're amazing we love you no come on give me something else Tyson grilled me yesterday for why I don't like him and I gave him like 20 reasons why you font what no but you have to think of something that's bad no Tyson asked me to say what's bad about him yeah well every single thing that I can mess around themselves did he take a while yeah of course cuz I cuz I already Grill him normally makes sense no like he actually wants to improved I think maybe you can see talking to the sky about like going to the gym and stuff I'm getting like tips and then I cannot imagine that weird attraction 1231 in the morning that it was in the kitchen and it was like in a group and he was just like giving cool but that's f***** up but true I do remember a lot of people where they live but not their names holy s*** I remember a lot of people by where they live that's good what you mean oh yeah but you still haven't answered my question oh that's too bad you didn't really need me here though cuz I had no ideakill yourself with very easy questions like that and now you get it see now you get it I'm programming I like really right now yeah I am I don't know I think I'm just not and the best mood right now I don't think I'm like mentally in the best mood right now so I usually just drown myself a lot of work because of that it's better to be it's better to be hardworking than to be like emotional little f*** you know what I mean yeah I always it's always worse mother I vent to someone about it but usually I don't like I mean I don't have anyone to so it it just I just do more work I feel like High School I feel like it's dumb like it's way too slow it's not interesting it's over I wanted to be over this year and it's not going to be over this year boy cuz I looked at their curriculum and I did a test and it was the same and everything I learned this year was exactly everything I learned two years ago I don't like that in University okay if I want to be like go to med school I have to get like a 3.8 GPA which is like no I'm good at doing hard questions I'm not good at doing easy questions consistency I just like thinking about problems and this is why I like programming it's when you get the obvious things wrong it's easy to fix it but you need to know how to do the hard things I know how to do the hard things I get the easy things wrong a lot but it's easy to fix but in school you do addition wrong and that tanks Your Average I don't like that and I'm going to struggle with that I think I don't know and also I talked to Tyson yesterday like like a very extensively for an hour yeah you stole his phone no I didn't steal his phone I didn't I didn't grab it he allowed me too that's funny though wasn't it that's funny yeah that's why I do things it's funny but yeah what happened to Tyson oh there's so many things I can talk about with Tyson I was talking about how you know how Tyson is not that kind of like a normal guy he's probably neural Divergent in some way he's autistic no he is no he he practically is but he's not actually diagnosed but I would say he is he's not I don't know I I know right I thought he like after Nick said that he was a tasting I feel like Tyson has to be that I know right no but Tyson is smarter he gets very good grades I I know right I thought he like after Nick said that he was a tasting I feel like Tyson has to be that I know right no but Tyson is smarter he gets very good gradeswe asked me about programming and he actually learns yeah so anyway as as wondering why like all my friends are kind of like neurodiversion in some way not you thank you but like throughout my life usually my friend groups have some sort of issue like I just feel like I don't know I'm not making that many normal friends like all your friends like except you and another Daniel who was my seat made for for 2 years by the way I love that Dad oh my God that Daniel is better than Daniel Steel yeah oh I was just talking about with Tyson about this look look at the server my Daniel Sis next to me for 8 hours today my Daniel has a smaller Social Circle my Daniel created this legendary screenshot this is my iPad by the way do you recognize it I recognize it Airsoft from Samsung Smart fridge failed his iPad is named Samsung Smart fridge and oh my Daniel walks towards my general direction of my house for 20 M longer than your Daniel and my Daniel sleeps for only 5 hours a day anyway yeah I was like why am I with you retards? but I don't know it's fun I'm I don't think I'm friends with I barely friends with her I barely talk to her I would like yeah we hang out like three four times that's it look if you don't talk to me like enough she's not active online yeah so other than a few people practically everyone else is like people wouldn't normally be friends with them Nick doesn't have a lot of friends oh my God he is nice I think he would actually be like really sad after I leave yeah yeah f*** this b**** powered by n i c t Ruth so that you sure whenever you in math class and you don't really want to listen to that you can do like you can try to find a question that's actually challenges yourself you know f*** your brother right see you later ohawesome I think I distinctly remember that guy the first time I came to the basement McDonald's ever this McDonald's that guy is the same guy who couldn't finish an apple pie he just came up to me and my dad randomly and he gave us an apple pie yeah see you in a bit sorry your parents going with you to us to Toronto no do you not like your parents why would you not want to live with them for like another couple years when you are an adult you're practically never going to see them again I can put money on the fact that I have a better relationship with my parents than any anyone in the school can you say like just f*** you to your mom but yeah yeah but like see you can take it really well yeah yeah my mom can do that too no my mom barely speaks English friends like anytime if I called her she would just come the next day cuz we have a really close relationship come the next day she ends up like work or anything she does but like like three businesses in Mexico but it's like like she controls them like she's the owner but the thing so your family is really rich rich online or whatever like sending emails that's why rich people need to go to work she can just stay with me for the entire day at home that happens what I have a s***** day I want my mom to f*** off because I spend like most of my time with my mom and dad I don't need to spend any more time with them have you ever had like a really good friend where you talk to them for so much that there's nothing there's nothing yeah like a lot like I'm going to have like a give me some Modern stuff wait do you have time tonight like like do you want to go on like a walk and you can like give me a job session why not I have so much work to do what works right now no but like okay can I give you like a prequel okay it's like no but you already gave me like a prequel I want a midcoal now or I want something modern like within the span of these four months I can give you something modern out of the past week sure cuz like okay and they were like and then we had a yaps about it so I'm good stories I have a lot of good stories yeah I'm not concerned about the quality of a stories I'm concerned about the fact that I don't get to hear them I'm good stories I have a lot of good stories yeah I'm not concerned about the quality of a stories I'm concerned about the fact that I don't get to hear themokay there's this thing when I Yap sash you have to pinky promise that you're not going to tell him sure in order for me but accept Tyson not Tyson not even Tysons okay okay let me turn the lights not even Tyson why my friends with Tyson I hate him I'm not kidding why what's so good about it exactly I know Tyson told me that he told Carter about the thing yeah what did he say yeah I said are you sure people get so mad about just like a game and that he is like yeah he's pretty mad and I didn't really actually trust him now that you confirmed it I feel like Juan is a little bit childish like I don't I don't think I like Juan I don't get what type of personality is I just don't get it he okay he's a type of person that can invent 12 12 paragraph statements okay and he also gets angry about gotcha okay those two things combine are not so good to who okay tell me about that okay so basically you have to promise like you you have to process like you you can't tell anyone else yeah like even though other people know you can't who else knows it's gone pretty big like basically everyone in the friend group knows and more people but like now you're getting the full story okay make it as unbiased as possible oh okay okay like her boyfriend right and then they were like on and off and stuff like that and then they finally broke up they broke up and everything and then a few weeks later her friend Yuki texted on being like Oh like Juliana single right now like go for her whatever and then she was like basically like supporting him like go for a go for a girlfriend Juliana yeah okay whatever few weeks later a few weeks ago he told me he was like oh I like Juliana I'm like oh s*** that's perfect cuz like I'm like okay let's see where this goes and I told him like okay do this and this like girls love this s*** and then he did that and then the next day Julian came up to me and she was like oh like Juan did this and this and I'm like oh and she was like blushing about and stuff like that and I was like do you like him and she's like I don't know and then every time in a conversation about that you can say I don't know instead of no it's so stupid well did you hear someone just came in and was like listening basicallyso you're basically an unreliable bridge is what I'm yeah basically I was thinking three times no you're not the wing woman you're a wingless woman cuz you're not helping them out and then Friday I was going to host on Friday right again and I told Julian I'm like oh like she's going to happen like on Friday you know like with you and like one and I also told one like oh s*** it's going to happen on Friday so like you and Juliana right and then Friday basically they were like being like basically a couple they were like holding hands like she like like they were very like physical touch right and at that moment like the next day we woke up cuz like Juliana stayed over my place and then she was telling me about all the things that happened you know how does that happen like you plan apart like you don't plan asleep over but they can just casually stay at your place what clothes do they have like dude he's not shower for a day okay so like what clothes he changed into okay so they knew it was going to be like a sleepover like for example this Friday yeah you're basically like a host for outlaws I don't know how I think it feel about that okay go okay and then the next morning so is Juan and then you know and then Quan was ready to like ask her to like be his girlfriend something like that cuz they were doing like a bunch of really really cute s*** like they had like matching like bracelets and she made him like a bracelet and like all this stuff so okay whatever the thing is I thought the exact same thing like oh that's so cringe but then once you're in a relationship it's cute I can't believe that like I used to be exactly but then once you experience it with someone it's like it makes your heart okay whatever so yeah all that was happening LOL then the next like few days happened or whatever Tuesday she was telling me that like oh yeah like my boyfriend like he plays tennis and you know and he's going my boyfriend plays tennis wait what who's telling who Juliana is telling you he's playing tennis again that's cool yeah and she was like oh I might go see the game and I'm like why why I might go see the game right are you basically like almost together with like fun but I did yes exactly what I thought yeah I'm like but I'm like I'm not going to say anything everyone has like second thoughts about like relationship and changes like difficult or whatever so I was like okay I'm not going to tell her cuz like it's just your thoughts if you actually puts action into it then that's a completely different story right and then once they were up like the cafeteria and then she comes up to this guy that's in the tennis team and was like oh yeah like they were just talking and then she came back to me and she was like oh yeah this is how long ago who was the guy he doesn't go to school like an hour away I don't think I'm going to go like I'm not desperate enough and I'm like yeah fair and then we went to the field to go with one and like Lewis and Coco and I'll be like those people after school period she's like oh do we have to go see her ex Alan to see her Timeless game you know that yeah and then one was beside me and he heard that oh and then he was that like delivery okay that's cool that's cool that's exactly what I would do it right then I looked atand he looks so he looks like so upset how does cuz he was going to ask her to be his girlfriend and they were already like doing s*** like not doing s*** but like you know physical touch it okay it's just one thing though yeah okay you know okay instead of doing that why couldn't like it instead of like dropping the entire thing why would you not try to salvage it by like asking her why she did that okay so when that happened so basically the second time he's heard that that's cool and then I told him like we were walking cuz I had to work and I told him I'm like well worth do you do come on like math do you teach kids Kumon is it like what do you do like what is Kumon stand for is it like internalizing multiplication you know I never did that as a kid yeah I never learned I never memorized anything for math or anything I'm not I found out like just a few days ago like last week you know how in English 12 we have to like memorize this poem I cannot like I can't because I like I'm like a very image-based person I can remember generally what is saying but if it doesn't use normal grammar I can't recreate it like I have to put signs in like my mental image just to show me like the words that are saying so you can't memorize for dog fit yeah I can memorize like images I don't know how I got this far in life period I never memorized anything I had for biology second time second time it's been mentioned had physics and there was like the 10 minute transition yeah cuz it's her class and then my class and then I came up to her and we were just talking and she was like Natalia like I got over an hour and I got over did you not say anything about it and in my head I was like oh that's so great things are kind of f***** up with one now so when they broke up with her call they never saw each other afterwards so she said that when she saw him she like completely lost feelings but she didn't feel anything and I said honestly like that's valid because one of the things that like help is like when you see someone who were with and you see them every single day like with me like was that I don't feel anything at all whatsoever why did you agree cuz I get it I get where she's coming from no why did you agree to date Zach that's a long story why I was just asking because you said like you have no feelings for that oh you lost so you dare to have how does that works and feelings are uncontrollable onceso your first time it lasted 5 months your second time is going to last fill in the blank that's a huge leap from 5 months he wanted to be in a relationship with me and so say does anyone know then why can't I know relationship with me and I told him off I'm like sorry like I'm not interested in anything serious poop why not yeah I honestly don't know that's good like I hope I didn't I hope I didn't I hope to one day draw myself with so much work that I don't socialize why not I like it but it has to risks I don't like risks I'm not a risk taker I want to work in a cubicle I'm not kidding I didn't say I didn't like socializing you like doing drugs you also like Vape you can like a lot of things doesn't mean it's like particularly I don't do like drug stores like hardcore drugs why do you vain why oh so many long stories do you want to quit yes or no how far in the future you fail to keep it up how long have you been like consistently when's the first time you've ate okay sounds like a reasonable timeline okay return return who is it yeah why why I don't like lies YouTube that's what you need to start doing that's what you need to start doingif they're going through it then it affects through what or you know this and that then it affects you because it affects you the fact that someone that you care about is hurting another reason why I don't like relationships you get it I don't get it but I mean that's a good reason that's normal that's normal but obviously he's going through breathe and going through a lot and hurting that's his problem because now it's a f****** everything like everything all aspects of his life and you can't see I wouldn't expect my friends to like do anything if my mom or dad died in a car crash really no yeah you're such a failure whatever did you just like vent about having a hard day no so how do they know you're having a hard day what do you mean like how do you know to send you a basket up thing I think the problem is if the extra sad that you can get to would make someone not want to talk like if I am not telling you a lot of stuff about my life like just a few months ago because yeah there's a lot of f****** s*** that happened like if you text me that night oh yeah Otis text me he's like the police was at your house what happened and I just told him yeah nothing and then like he said okay yeah that's that's usually how I expected to go if you're actually like really really sad yeah for what I mean you don't say but like okay since you tell me a lot of stuff but then you don't give me the juice I'm going to tell you something so funny okay and I'm not going to tell you the rest if you call us suicide hotline not for myself if you call a suicide hotline you got to wait for 5 minutes I tried like three the main three in Canada have you ever tried that you have to internalize that for like a long time I'm not suicidal by the way yeah it's very easy it takes time to process that's insane I didn't know that like 9/11 it doesn't take time to process I would feel like the government could do better because I was saying that I would think that in Hong Kong it answers immediately because my friend said it does yeah but here it takes yeah it take five minutes and I tried like three who's this a few months ago second semester suck it up b**** workbecause I try to work harder yeah and my Daniel also does that he's the one who taught me like he's the one who most influenced me in this type of thinking I think and when and when my like entire like life Legacy was destroyed like in front of my eyes one day you know I ran at school for 4 hours a day and I didn't back it up and someone just like deleted it that's like 4 years of work down the drain I cried myself for like 2 hours that night and then this that week I did like a lot of work they deleted your like what do you mean they deleted my world yeah it was are you like being funny harmonic like I get you I get you dude you have no idea how how much Minecraft matter to me like my English is at this level because of Minecraft gosh and I also dude I also don't play on things like Hypixel I play on my own world that I host on my own that I do everything on my own yeah it's like it's like if you build your MacBook from scratch and then someone dropped it for you and you also didn't back up your files it was some random guy it doesn't matter I actually want to meet the guy now and like chill with it it's really sad that I didn't back it off I'm so stupid but I was only a kid yeah 11:00 so sad anyway yeah I I was very productive after that like not in a school way and on my way like I built a lot of things I did a lot of things with friends I thought a lot of people a lot more things and I learned how to type faster on a keyboard I think that's good though that you turned those like negative feelings or whatever into being productive it's not turned into being productive it's being productive drowns out negative field because when you hurt from stress you don't manage to have space to hurt from anything else yeah cool so the case competition was a really good Escape for me too no it's just a really good chance for me to forget about everything else like how much school sucks no just this school sucks oh my security question too Nina for the deposit you know the answer has to be Argyle right I wrote what's the worst school ever and then she had to answer our God honey do you mind deposit for you got to do that like now $6 how does it work you have 10 no 1:00 p.m. I have to build my own s*** I don't have a kid oh my God no way yeah okay brought like all the food and everything okay that's good that's good but he's fat that's the only thing that I hate most about Tyson I'm a bad person anywayI just I can't get over the fact that yuck I hate myself for that I don't know why I'm so bye I feel like it's like a juicy steak I wouldn't eat it with my hands okay anyway yeah dude tell me who the guy was why not is it in our grade do I know that do I know them I don't know then okay then it's just some guy yeah okay continue your story yeah I got you rejected guy you guys text it no but he came to your house two times you know we just like talk and something like that cuz he's a really good person to like Gap with and stuff like that that's good I think I think after I came to Canada I was just I just got less yappy no I didn't wait actually I have so much with Tyson I think just with you I'm either a very tired or it's way more existential for me yeah like do you think you have we have like a lot of like decomposition no it's just it's just a very deep for me because I have to internalize how you guys feel and I don't usually do that what what Tyson he's not with Tyson we talk about like logic and morals and stuff yeah and programming those are very concrete Concepts I I can grab these are very subjective these are like way too emotional for me too I don't usually yeah but it's good drama I like that I was never involved in drama in my school before because did you know that I was in like a retard class I'm just kidding yeah I was in an international curriculum so basically what how is horses okay imagine our grade works exactly like how it was but there was one class of 16 people that had the same course each day and never interacted with the rest of the grade I was in that class for 2 years and this year if I stayed there so all the drama happened in that grade and I was with 16 people the entire time 8 hours a day five days a week and my class had really f****** introverted people and I didn't really get to socialize with them Daniel my Daniel is actually a very introverted no I don't know what's wrong with him he has like a lot of trauma from thanks that happened that he doesn't want to tell me about him I know a lot about him I don't know about the trauma but I know how to affects him though yeah I can like I literally quantize his his amount of trauma by doing experiments on him and he plays along like he actually helps out yeah I would ask him a question and he would have to like think about the question and there was like this app where it tested your reaction time and he needs to process the question while doing the reaction time thing so I did like yeah so I quantized what triggered him the most he didn't tell anyone though so I don't think I was like an exception he told me the most out of everyone else no other than this one girl who I think he has a crush on but this girl I'm pretty sure she's f****** gay or something doesn't like it and text like so dry she text so dry and it's really bad for him I think it just in general in my life not in general at all times in my life relationships has been like a total detriment to anyone's existence yeah you can no you can cuz you were anyone you idiot?overhyped I wouldn't describe it like that why why would you want to be in love person well by your mom relationship what's the difference that she gives you the love from my mom is not unconditioned if I'm a drug addict she would kick me out of the house right now is it stop how is the sky so bright that's insane happy birthday Caitlin Russell who the f*** is
