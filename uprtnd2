let "benefit" be a scalar of consequences, such that the higher the benefit, the more you want it.
	eating icecream has benefit: You want to taste the sweetness
	eating paper has less benefit: Paper tastes bad
	doing homework is somewhere inbetween: Who likes doing homework? still, not worse than eating paper.

/// take a moment to think of any action you ever take. You can put them on this scale



=========

Imagine for a second that a child was taught for his entire life "eating crayons is unhealthy, vaccines work, eating apples make you immortal"

IF the child does not check the soundness of these statements, it will still influence his "benefit" ranking of each action
we can reasonably approximate is views on each action.

This demonstrates:
	1. The "benefit" ranking of each action is subjective
	2. The "benefit" of an item can be skewed away from reality


Humans make decisions to maximize their INDIVIDUAL benefit


=========

Dumb decisions exist.

A hypothetical reasonable child gets really angry at his classmate.
In the heat of the moment, the child beats his classmates up.
It is not that the child does not understand the consequences: If he thought about it more, he would have made a better decision - not beating the classmate up.

This demonstrates:
	1. It takes time for humans to rank any actions "benefit"

The child thought of the SHORT TERM "benefit" only. Revenge was beneficial, however the longer term consequences (punishment) were not considered

The less time you have to consider your options, the more stupid your final decision eventually becomes.
This does not mean you are not using the same scaling algorithm to ATTEMPT to maximize your own benefit.

Public infrastructure that help people can be exploited

Why does public infrastructure need to exist?

Capitalism <--> communism

Theoretically, its worth the tax for the rich person because His money benefiting society is inherantly beneficial

You have a choice: 

You have no choice with your money

v
You have more safeguard from society






let Y be the benefit YOU CAN THINK OF


It takes X dollars to get Y benefit

Is tax > X dollars?

yes: i dont want public service
no: i want public service

^ this can be wrong.



let Z be the benefit god knows you will get

It takes X dollars to get Z benefit for you

Is tax > X dollars?

yes: i shouldnt want public service
no: i should want public service



the more poor ppl there is, the worse public services are for a rich person
the more poor the people are, the worse public services are for a rich person
