The block of land in the bottom left corner of the map, which was formerly a home in 1700, has been divided into two, with a supermarket on the east side next to Saint Peter's Street. On the west side of the property, where there were businesses and a sizable grassy area in 1700, there are now residential homes next to Streggle street, as well as an addition of shops that are lined along High street. The Goode farm was located north of the market square in 1700. In its stead, six houses have been constructed next to Steggle road, a car park has taken the position of Goode farm entirely, and other buildings have been lined up just to the west of Market street.


The following boring paraph tells map illiterate people how the Town centre is laid out.

A market square can be seen in the center of the entire map. A hotel is located to the left of the market square, while a church is located to the right. Stables are located above St. Peters Lane to the right of all that clutter, and two residences are located over those stables. Goode Farm, a sizable property across Market Street, is crossed by a bridge that spans a surprisingly narrow river to the left of it. Steggle Farm and Houses are located on the bottom left and right corners of the map, respectively. Three stores are located parallel to the horizontal street at the bottom. There are some fields beneath the shops.

A supermarket is located on the east side of the plot of land that was once a house at the bottom left corner of the map, next to Saint Peter's Street. The plot was once a home in 1700. There are currently residential homes close to Streggle street on the west side of the land where there were enterprises and fields in 1700, as well as an addition of shops that are lined along High street. In 1700, the Goode farm was positioned to the north of the market. Six new homes have been built adjacent to Steggle Road in its place, Goode Farm has completely been replaced by a parking lot, and other structures have been stacked up close to the west of Market Street.







- YES.

- Who wants to work anyway?
-- why do you want to work?
--- you want to work for money
---- in the future robots would do almost everything. So goods won't really cost money.
---- For example, if robots took over the entire farming industry, why would food be worth anything? it wouldnt.

--- You want to work because you are insecure and need something to do to find your identity
---- then you just work and not get paid. Why not?

conclusion: who cares about the workforce being threatened if Quality of life improves.
TLDR; More robot -> stuff cheap -> no work needed; UBI solves everything.

Benefits: stuff are cheap. Teachers will be replaced.
Disbeneficialities: stubborn people want jobs for no reason.
stupid gap widens. (people in the stupid job industries get replaced). Well its their fault if they dont want to learn.









I believe the ultimate goal of humanity right now is just to prolong our lifespan. Aging is the world's most prominent disease, and I believe curing aging is right around the corner, and I think studying biochemistry will be the most helpful for me, to learn about how cells work at a molecular level, because I aspire to personally contribute to anti-aging research as much as I can. Biochemistry is a field that is constantly evolving and has the potential to make a significant impact on society. I am drawn to the idea that biochemistry can be used to solve real-world problems, and I feel compelled to help find solutions by furthering my education in this field. 

  

Although I am a very practical person, I am still interested in most science subjects, but in my view, the school system in Hong Kong was not challenging my mind at all and was limiting my ability to learn in the most efficient way on account of wasting my time. I have enjoyed spending my free time learning programming and creating unique programs to shorten my work flow. Maintaining these projects and creating new things were very fulfilling to me because they were challenging enough to pique my interest, so I made significant progress with learning programming from high-level to low-level languages in the free time I had. As someone with a background in programming, I have always been fascinated by the intersection of technology and biology. This curiosity has led me to pursue studies in biochemistry, as I believe that understanding the underlying chemical processes that occur within human beings is crucial for developing new technologies that can benefit humanity. 

  

I was always very intrigued by how life works on a molecular level and how all organisms function. As a child, I was very surprised by the fact that there are still a lot of things about how the human body works that are not known, which further sparked my curiosity and interest. From my few trips to the Hong Kong university, I have visited a few of their biology labs, and each time I entered, the sublime quiet solidified my opinion that I wanted to be studying biochemistry. 

  

In conclusion, I am eager to pursue a degree in biochemistry because of my passion for science, my desire to solve real-world problems, and my commitment to making a difference in society. I am excited for the opportunity to further my education and contribute to the ever-evolving field of biochemistry.

Subject: F**king Submission of Supporting Documents for Application, You B**tards

Dear Sh*tty Imaginary Admission Officer,

I'm about to f**king apply to your godd*mn fictional university, but I can't find any f**king information on how to submit my d*mn supporting documents. Seriously, what kind of f**ked up website do you guys have? It's like you don't even want us to apply, you imbeciles.

You better get your sh*t together and tell me how the f**k I'm supposed to send these d*mn documents. Is it through some sh*tty online portal, or do I have to waste my f**king time mailing them to your dumb*ss office?

Don't even think about taking your sweet f**king time to reply, because I swear to god, I'll lose my sh*t. And you better give me a clear, f**king detailed explanation, or I'll unleash my wrath on your incompetent university.

Looking forward to your f**king response,

[Your F**king Name]

P.S. You're damn lucky I even considered applying to your trashy, fictional university. Get your sh*t together.




















consumers will benefit from the increased efficincy 

when you have a negative advrt campaign, what are the effects

My claim X: the ONLY reason you care about intention is becaues it affects outcome

True or false: you believe that the intentions matter when outcome is the same


There are two types of scenarios.
1. a scenario where outcome is guaranteed to be the same
2. a scenario where outcome is not the same (real word)

note that in both scenarios, "outcome" is something at least somewhat subjectively measurable

for every time you are trying to prove that you only care about intention, you are giving an example of some scenario with DIFFERENT intentions and SAME outcome.

Ask yourself, whether the action is REALLY THE SAME.

Is the reason why you care about the intention because people with that intention are more likely in the future to to give you outcomes that benefit you?


It is important to consider that every action has a long term affect that would make the outcome different
Even if the short term outcome is the same <- this is why we need to educate people about long term effects, so that they learn the outcome is actually not the same.

For the case of teaching, carrie chan probably doesnt know that her students hate her because of what she does, or doesnt understand the long term outcome consequence for the students by being a strict teacher.

For the case of voting, the person who treats both the racist and thinking voter the same would be a fool, because they're only looking at the short term outcome.
The reason why you should choose the thinking voter is because in the future they would have more of a chance to produce an outcome that matches what you want.









Our dear opponents told us that a competative market creates a more leveled playing field.
Dear opponents, have you ever considered that the size of different companies create a horrible uneven playing field especially in negative advertizing? Imagine big companies targeting small companies in negative advertising campaigns. it would be so skewed because consumers are already used to trusting the big companies. Imagine the small company having to deal with an abundance of biased information presented by the giant company. 
How is this a level playing field?


people dont pay attention to ads -> success rate?

We said that people dont pay attentions to ads and our dear opponents gave examples of successful advertisements.
i think our dear opponents are misunderstanding our point.
we said that to illustrate that consumers are very vulnerable to biased and false information. If anything successful negative advertisements are successful because it represents information in a way that tricks people into thinking 


Hostile and harmful market, can be conducted in respectful promote healthy comp -> they are encouraged
Although unethical, overstated. can be conducted responsibly. by holding companies accountable more ethical -> literally biased



effectiveness: 
showing shortcoming may seem unethical
willing to be critical of others: more honest, increases the trust highlighting their unique strengths




not inherant irrisponsible






enhance consumer education, making our market healthily competative
educate.

promote healathy competition. Are you sure it is healthy?

perspective of freedom and effectiveness


end up beneficial. How? answer us opponents, how is biased information good for the market? are you sure this is informing the consumers?

lost of trust -> extreme cases. usual advertisement. Again i will tell you how the examples in our case

banning -> infringing on the rights. 
limit the ability to communicate


neg = not ethical : when comapnies are exposing weakness, its not ethical. consumers have the right to know the weaknesses to have an informed choice



holding business accountable, drawing attention to more important features of products

hostile -> competition ofcourse there is criticism (why cant competition be positive)
society is developed by competition. why cant the competition be positive instead of stepping on others?
society will benefit because we will enjoy better services. Ill talk about how actually a positive market atmosphere will actually benefit the consumers & services later on, how it is actually more effective for us as a society to focus on positive competition instead of having to attack each other.




negative ad positive results
more competition -> better products




1. negative ads can be used to hold companies accountable. by exposing, companies can be held accountable for their unjust actions.
2. important to know the truth, neg ads are regulated by the market


Its naive for you to think that companies always play by the rules, an ambitious negative ad campaign can easily topple the reputation of their targeted competitor. this damage is irriversible.

Many studies already show that customers love drama and are vulnerable to misleading information. The thought that consumers are going to going to hold companies accountable is overly optimistic in a society where deception and bias is used to promote products.



3. neg ads can level the playing field. By underdogs to challenge dominant players, create a more competative enviornment

reb 1: neg ad must be false. 
reb 2: lose trust? more critical (biasly)

1. freedom of speech, without fear or censorship
2. consumers choice, valuable information

Jason: misleading information
Therefore show drawbacks of information

Dove 

K:Exagerrated claims, neg ads mean a win win situation 

1.Pos ad doesnt mean companies will be more transparent 
2.Encourages critical thinking by challengin the claims provided by companies, companies can promote informed decision mkaing
3.Market efficiency, allow customers to distunge between different brands  
4.Public interest, expose companies that conduct illegal activities = make companies act more responsibly 













Goal: doubt the quality of the competitors product


Exclude falsified claims.
neg ads pos outcomes
provide consumers with more information
expose unethical practices

providing a means of leveling the playing field

more information. -> more informed purchacing decisions (more effective at providing information)
promotes competition and innovation to gain competative advantage.


neg ad campaigns harmful -> Ad campaigns regulated
neg ad campigns can be designed in a way to be respectful


unethical and misleading -> designed in a way that is truthful



our dear opponents claimed that negative advertisements encourage innovation. Dear opponents, better products encourage innovation, not aggressive attacks. If you beat up your children to teach them lessons they WOULD learn. But is it ethical or neccessary? Similarly, negative ad campaigns used unethical ways to attack other companies, But their aim is not to help others improve at all. If you were going against competitors you wouldnt want them to innovate.


highlight competitors flaws

beneficial
allow: not 100% good

in line with freedom of speech & differentiate products
grabs attention and mobilise consumers

freedom actively attacking (equal status, one company is criticising others)
generate more attention than positive ads.



use positive over negative ads







concentrate on pointing out undesirable aspects

Help companies be better
enhance consumers awareness

neg ad can be factual, effective and promotes consumer awareness
companies survive due to negative advertising
push them to be competative
improve product quality

please be mindful of survivalship bias
regulations
effective way

neg ads create hostile -> this is because focused on negative, neg isnt bad infact it can hold companies accountable, promotes transparency
Effective in promoting healthy competition "telling ur friends that you are stronger"

what is wrong with u bro look i can actually type without looking at the screen







neg always aim to destroy other company?

without competition there is no market

they serve useful purposes
winwin consumers and market

no false information
consumers will be benefited: provide useful information might be
highlighting important information;


neg = biased, practically everbodys biased
there will be competition, there will be rivalries
negative ads were more effective for companies to improve
encourage innovation and shitMy claim X: the ONLY reason you care about intention is becaues it affects outcome

accountable



negative ads are more effective







neg ad improves market efficiency

Neg ad -> marketing strag
does not have to be hostile

incentives

model: neg ads is complementary for consumer reviews.
all advertisement laws, defames competitors using false claims -> lawsuit
beneficial to consumers,

not direct comparison.
fails to provide sufficient information.



Neg ads only lead to hostile market -> neg ad doesnt always have to be hostile
misleading information

avoid mistakes.
