same charge -> higher proton -> smaller radius

Effective Nuclear Charge = Atomic number - Screening constant

shielding constant -> screening constant

homology -> similarity due to shared ancestry
morphology -> finding similarity by strucure

you know how its a pain in the ass to find some shit in canvas
and ctrl+f doesnt usually work cuz in another webpage
i can make a ctrl+f work for multiple web pages and also give u the link








var a; var b

let l = document.links
let r = []

function myFind(){
	for(let i = 0; i < l.length; i++){
		GetWeb(l[i].href,i)
	}
}

function mySearch(wrd){
	r.forEach((e,i)=>{
		let ind = e.indexOf(wrd)
		if(ind == -1){return}
		console.log(l[i].text+" found at "+ind)
	})
}


function GetWeb(link,i){
	fetch(link).then(res=>{return(res.text())}).then(txt=>{r[i] = txt})
}


fetch("https://canvas.ubc.ca/courses/155723").then(response=>{return(response.text())}).then(text=>{console.log(text); a = text})







Q
why doesnt an electron just fall into the proton
are tails limbs?

Analytical vs eulers method:



The equation for analytical method will always produce a perfect result for what you ask it to do
But you are asking it to do the wrong thing

I dont know the analytical equation for with drag


yes. It is much easier to model anything with eulers model, and much harder for analytical equations
But eulers is always wrong by a bit

























Analytical is always perfect
eulers is an estimate of analytical


BUT

they have to be modeling the same thing

In this case, the analytical is producing "The perfect graph for no drag"
and the eulers is producing "Not so perfect graph WITH drag"

so eulers method is more accurate to real life because there is drag
But analytical is PERFECT at what it does, 


Also, if you knew the ANALYTICAL equation with drag, it will be better than euler method with drag



Here is an analogy i guess

An Atom clock is more accurate than a mechanical clock

But, an atom clock can be more wrong than a mechanical clock if you put in some situations
Like flying really fast
