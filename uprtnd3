i can make a ctrl+f work for multiple web pages and also give u the link








var a; var b

let l = document.links
let r = []

function myFind(){
	for(let i = 0; i < l.length; i++){
		GetWeb(l[i].href,i)
	}
}

function mySearch(wrd){
	r.forEach((e,i)=>{
		let ind = e.indexOf(wrd)
		if(ind == -1){return}
		console.log(l[i].text+" found at "+ind)
	})
}


function GetWeb(link,i){
	fetch(link).then(res=>{return(res.text())}).then(txt=>{r[i] = txt})
}


fetch("https://canvas.ubc.ca/courses/155723").then(response=>{return(response.text())}).then(text=>{console.log(text); a = text})
